# Bezier_Curves
Simple application in Qt for displaying and manipulating bezier curves. I'm planning to implement calculation of distance between two bezier curves in the future, based on [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849311000641) paper. This would help in using bezier curves to represent the paths of mobile robots along with determining possible collisions between them.
